This repository contains the official implementation of experiments for the paper [Sliding Puzzles Gym: A Scalable Benchmark for State Representation in Visual Reinforcement Learning](). This includes PPO, SAC, and DreamerV3 implementations along with scripts to reproduce all results.

The code for PPO was adapted from the [CleanRL implementation](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo_atari.py), and the code for DreamerV3 was adapted from the [official implementation](https://github.com/danijar/dreamerv3).
The benchmark environment itself can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/spgym-anonymous-F6FE.

## Requirements

1. Setup the benchmark

To install the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://anonymous.4open.science/r/spgym-anonymous-F6FE sliding-puzzle-env
cd sliding-puzzle-env
pip install -e .
```

To use the `imagenet-1k` dataset you will also need to download the dataset from https://huggingface.co/datasets/ILSVRC/imagenet-1k/blob/main/data/val_images.tar.gz and extract it to `<package install location>/imgs/imagenet-1k`. You can do this automatically by running the following command:

```bash
sliding-puzzles setup imagenet
```

2. Prepare Python environments

Create separate Python environments for Dreamer and PPO. `requirements.txt` can be found inside each correspondent folder, and Dockerfiles are also available. See `dreamer/README.md` and `ppo/README.md` for more details.

## Training

Scripts for reproducing the paper results can be found in `dreamer/scripts` and `ppo/scripts`. Seeds are generated automatically by the algorithms if not specified. For example, inside `dreamer` or `ppo` folders, run:

```train
bash scripts/scale.sh
```

## Results

These are the expected results:

<small><b>Learning curves for DreamerV3, PPO and SAC variants.</b> Shaded regions represent 95\% confidence intervals across 5 independent runs.</small>

![Success Rates](docs/scale_comparison.png)

<small><b>Success rate as a function of environment steps.</b> The gradual increase in representation complexity affects the sample efficiency of standard PPO, SAC, and DreamerV3 agents at different rates. Each line represents a different pool size, from 1 to 100 images. Shaded regions represent 95\% confidence intervals across 5 independent seeds.</small>
